# Recomended homework

## What was I supposed to be doing?
Building a portfolio gallery, about me, and contact pages in a  website for myself

## Technologies used:
* HTML
* CSS

## What I did:
For this assignment I used HTML to build the basic structure of the about me page and then used CSS to style it according to the reference image. I then used HTML to build the structure of the next two pages and tweaked my CSS file accordinly

## Problems I encountered:
While writing the HTML for my about me page, I left an img tag open and didn't catch it until doing my final runthrough about an hour and a half before the assignment was due, and couldn't figure out what tweaks needed to be made in order to keep the page looking right while having the proper formatting before the deadline came up.
